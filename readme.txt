This plugin adds an AJAX tag widget to your WooCommerce shop.
== Description ==
The _WooCommerce Ajax tags_ allows customers to sort products based on tags instead of variations. For example: 
Show all products with tag "Tshirt" or show all products with tag "Jumper" and "Jersey". 

This plugin still needs some development, but if you just need a basic AJAX tag widget it will do. 
We hope to release and updated version in a couple of weeks which works better.
